# My cyberpunk 2020 game

I just want to play a game of cyberpunk 2020 with my friends in a specific setting, and here's the page I use to make it more flavourful for everybody.

## Charsheet

I also decided to add an interactive charsheet. It turns out to be pretty complex with all the 2020 mechanics - I'm once again impressed by this system.
It started as a tiny script to quickly count armor degradation...

## Plans

The charsheet should grow into a proper multi-tab SPA - tabs by real-world by usage:
- combat
- roleplay (thinking skills + notes, maybe separate NPC contact list, ...)
- inventory management
- ??? shop, character creation, lifepath generator... Not really on the roadmap but sounds cool.

All these should be generic enough to be used in any cyberpunk 2020 game, not just mine.
